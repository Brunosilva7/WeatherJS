# WeatherJS

A weather appllication with JS + API

Basically how's the application works?

- The users should write inside the blank a country, city, which they would like to see the weather. Wherever the location is, the application will show either is their country or abroad.

- Then the application is going to show some weather's information about that place with the API I've used.

## OpenWeather API:

I've choose the openWeather API because is one of the most important website, when we're talking about climates, weather and etc.
dispite that to implement the API inside the code, they have step by step easily within their website how we could do it.

- There is something that we must be aware, to implement the API we should create an account in their website, because they'll create a API key to controls how many times you've been using their API.
- Your API key is require to use within the Javascript code. Let me show you an example:

I've choose the JSON way to storage the API's informations and show it, but it could be done however you prefer. 

I hope you'll enjoy it.
